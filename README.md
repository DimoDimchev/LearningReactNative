This is a repository for a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ixPU-QkScoRBVxtPPzVjrQ) I followed to help me get started with mobile development with React Native. During this course I developed several small-scale React Native app which I will showcase below.

- State hooks
- Navigation
- Components and custom components
- Forms with Formik
- Validation with Yup
