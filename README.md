# LearningReactNative

This is a repository for a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ixPU-QkScoRBVxtPPzVjrQ) I followed to help me get started with mobile development with React Native. During this course I developed several small-scale React Native app which I will showcase below.

In this tutorial I learned about:
- Creating app layouts
- State hooks
- Navigation
- Components and custom components
- Forms with Formik
- Validation with Yup
- Fetching data from API's using React Native

I also built the following apps:
| ToDo App | Reviews app |

State hooks are used throught the app as well as various custom components and touchable components | <img src="https://github.com/DimoDimchev/LearningReactNative/blob/main/assets/reviewsapp_showcase.gif" align='left' height=400> An app for movie reviews where users can add reviews via a Formik form which is validated with Yup. This app uses various custom components, state hooks, stack navigation and more. All of the reviews are dynamically stored in a Firebase Realtime Database which makes the app a bit better |
